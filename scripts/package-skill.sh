#
# package-skill.sh, zip a skill folder into an installable .skill file.
#
# A .skill is just a zip of the skill's files with SKILL.md inside. This script
# builds one from skills/<name>/, placing every file at the ROOT of the archive
# (the layout Claude Desktop installs cleanly) and skipping junk like .DS_Store.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/package-skill.sh <skill-name>       # one skill
#   scripts/package-skill.sh --all              # every skill under skills/
#
# Output: dist/<name>.skill  (build artifacts; dist/ is gitignored)
#
# Example:
#   scripts/package-skill.sh firm-discovery
#   → dist/firm-discovery.skill  (upload this in Claude Desktop → Settings → Skills)
