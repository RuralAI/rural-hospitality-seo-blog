/**
 * sync-skills.mjs, regenerate the skill files that are copies of canonical
 * src/ or config/ sources, so the skills can never ship stale logic.
 *
 * The skills run in a sandbox that only contains the files zipped into the
 * .skill, so they can't import from src/ at runtime, they carry self-contained
 * copies. This script makes src/ the single source of truth: it copies each
 * source listed in skills/sync-manifest.json to its skill destination, stamping
 * an AUTO-GENERATED banner on .mjs files so nobody hand-edits them.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/sync-skills.mjs           # regenerate the skill copies (write)
 *   node scripts/sync-skills.mjs --check   # verify they're in sync; exit 1 if not
 *
 * See docs/skills-bundled-copy-drift.md and the anti-drift design spec.
